Godot 2D essentials is a collection of production ready components to speed up the development of your 2d games. This components handles basic behaviours without affecting the particular logic of your game and highly customisable.

We provide you a few examples on how to use them in the folder **examples** that you can find in this repository

# ‚ú®Installation
You can download this plugin from the official [godot asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset) or manually download it from this repository directly in your project addons folder
# üê±‚ÄçüèçGetting started
This is nothing more than a collection of new nodes that you can add as a new scene like you usually do when working with the Godot game engine.

# üê±‚ÄçüöÄAvailable components
Here you can find the full available list of components, be sure to read the documentation for each component before use in your project to get the most out of it.
## HealthComponent
This one manages all related to taking damage and health on the parent node, usually you add this to a **CharacterBody2D** but nothing prevents from being used in a **StaticRigidBody2D** if you want to make alive a tree or any other game object.

### Setup
Add this component as a child in which node you want to add a life and damage logic, the next steps are:
- Set the initial values you desire for this component
- (Optional) To enable health regen you need to add a value greater than zero for the parameter `health regen per second` and add a Timer as a child with the name `HealthRegenTimer`
- (Optional) To enable the possibility to activate invulnerability you need to add another Timer as a child with the name `InvulnerabilityTimer`

### Taking damage
Easy as call the function `damage` inside the component, a signal `health_changed` is emitted everytime receives damage while checking if the current health has reached zero, in which case it additionaly emits a `died` signal.

If the variable `is_invulnerable` is true, the damage received will be zero but signals will continue to be broadcast normally.

```python
health_component.damage(10)
```
### Health
The behavior is the exact same as damage but this time add health to the component, it can never reach the `max_health` defined. A signal `health_changed` is emitted everytime this health function is called.

```python
health_component.health(25)
```

### Health regeneration per second
By default, the health regeneration is set to be **every second** and need to be activated as we describe in the Setup section above. When the health component call the function `damage()` the regeneration is enabled until reach the max health where it will be deactivated.
### Invulnerability
You can disable or enable the invulnerability using the function `enable_invulnerability(enable: bool, time: float = 0.05)` passing as parameter if is active and the time in seconds that will be invulnerable where it will be deactivated when reachs the timeout.

```python
health_component.enable_invulnerability(true, 2.5)

# you can deactivating it manually with
health_component.enable_invulnerability(false)

```
