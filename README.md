Godot 2D essentials is a collection of production ready components to speed up the development of your 2d games. This components handles basic behaviours without affecting the particular logic of your game.

We provide you a few examples on how to use them in the folder **examples** that you can find in this repository

# Requirements
- Godot 4+

# ‚ú®Installation
## Automatic (Recommended)
You can download this plugin from the official [godot asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset)
## Manual 
Create an **addons** folder in the root of your godot project and add the content of this repository inside it
# üê±‚ÄçüèçGetting started
This is nothing more than a collection of new nodes that you can add as a new scene like you usually do when working with the Godot game engine. They were designed to be flexible enough to adapt to what your game mechanics are looking for.

# Global Helpers Node
This plugin provides a global singleton named `Helpers` to contain all the stuff that can be shared globally and can be useful in your game. 

## Generate random directions from an origin Vector2
This function generate a `n` random directions in a `Array[Vector2]` format from an starting vector point defining the min and max angles:
```python
# 5 Random directions from Vector down (0, 1) between 90¬∫ and 180¬∫
Helpers.generate_random_directions_on_angle_range(Vector2.DOWN, 90, 180, 5)

# 25 random directions from the actual player global position between 0 and 360¬∫
Helpers.generate_random_directions_on_angle_range(player.global_position, 0, 360, 25)
```

## Frame Freeze
To achieve a slow-motion effect you can use this function that receives the time scale *(as time goes by frame by frame)* and
the duration of the freeze in seconds.
```
Helpers.frame_freeze(0.05, 0.5)
```

### Signals
**frame_freezed** signal is emitted When the effect starts in case you want to listen to it to perform other actions such as triggering animations. Here you can see a basic example:
```
func _ready():
	Helpers.frame_freezed.connect(on_frame_freezed)

func on_frame_freezed():
	animated_sprite.play("juicy_hurt")
	 ...
```


# üê±‚ÄçüöÄAvailable components
Here you can find the full available list of components, be sure to read the documentation for each component before use in your project to get the most out of it.
## üíñHealthComponent
This one manages all related to taking damage and health on the parent node, usually you add this to a **CharacterBody2D** but nothing prevents from being used in a **StaticRigidBody2D** if you want to make alive a tree or any other game object.

### Setup
Add this component **as a child** in which node you want to add a life and damage logic, just define the the initial values you desire for this component:

![health_component_parameters](images/health_component_parameters.PNG)

### Taking damage
Easy as call the function `damage` inside the component with the amount desired to subtract, a signal `health_changed` is emitted everytime receives damage while checking if the current health has reached zero, in which case it additionaly emits a `died` signal.

If the variable `is_invulnerable` is true, the damage received will be zero whatever amount receive but signals will continue to be broadcast as normal.

```python
health_component.damage(10)
```
### Healing
The behavior is the exact same as damage but this time add health to the component. This healing can never exceed the defined `max_health` on the component. A signal `health_changed` is emitted everytime this health function is called.
```python
health_component.health(25)
```

### Health regeneration per second
By default, the health regeneration is set to be **every second**. When the health component call the function `damage()` the regeneration is enabled until reach the max health where it will be deactivated.

You can change the amount per second dinamically using the function `enable_health_regen` or set to zero if you want to disable it:

```python
health_component.enable_health_regen(10)
# or disable it
health_component.enable_health_regen(0)

```
### Invulnerability
You can disable or enable the invulnerability using the function `enable_invulnerability(enable: bool, time: float = 0.05)` passing as parameters if is active and the time in seconds that will be invulnerable where it will be deactivated when reachs the timeout.

```python
health_component.enable_invulnerability(true, 2.5)

# you can deactivating it manually with
health_component.enable_invulnerability(false)
```
### When health reachs zero
This component only emits a signal `died` to allow the behavior to be customizable for your game, just connect to this component signal and run the animations, function calls, collect statistics, etc.
#### Check manually if it's death
You can make use of the function `check_is_death` if you want to detect this state on a manual way.

### Percentage of actual health
You can retrieve the health percentage format with the function `get_health_percent()` in case you want to display health bar UI



### Signals
```python
# You can access the action type in the health_changed signal
# to determine what kind of action was taken and act accordingly to the flow of your game.
enum TYPES {
	DAMAGE,
	HEALTH,
	REGEN
}

signal health_changed(amount: int, type: TYPES)
signal invulnerability_changed(active: bool)
signal died
```

## üöÄVelocityComponent2D
Whether top-down, platformer or grid-based, this component offers the functionality you need without having to rewrite it yourself for each project. The movement can be made flexible with the exposed parameters and contains an internal API that facilitates the most common actions that can occur in a 2d game.

üßá ***(This component does not register controller inputs, it is a headless component that only applies movement to one node.***

## Speed group
All parameters and function here relates to node movement.
### Move
This is a shorcut that update the velocity and call the method `move_and_slide()`. Can receive the `CharacterBody2D` node via parameter or access the parent to whom this component belongs.

### Accelerate in direction
This define the direction *(Vector2)* is going to accelerate smoothly using the **Speed** group parameters defined in the component, by itself does not move the node, you have to chain the call to the method `move` 

```python
var direction: Vector2 = Input.get_vector("ui_left", "ui_right", "ui_up", "ui_down").normalized()

velocity_component_2d.accelerate_in_direction(direction).move()
```

### Accelerate to target 
Same behavior as `accelerate_in_direction` but this time taking a target *(Node2D)* as parameter that will define the direction in which it will move.

```python
var player = get_tree().get_first_node_in_group("player") as CharacterBody2D

velocity_component_2d.accelerate_to_target(player).move()
```

### Decelerate
Stop moving the node gradually to `Vector2.ZERO` velocity

```python
velocity_component_2d.decelerate()
```

## Dash group
This component allows you to enable a dash functionality, also supports a number of dashes which each add a timer to free it from the queue and enable it again.

### Dash
This function moves the node fastly in the last faced direction of the node by default. You can provide a different direction as parameter. This function trigger a signal `dashed` in case you want to add extra functionality when you dash

```python
if Input.is_just_action_pressed("dash"):
	velocity_component_2d.dash()
	#or 
	velocity_component_2d.dash(other_direction)
```
### Enable or disable Dash
You can enable or disable the dash feature using the function `enable_dash` passing the new cooldown between dashes and the times you can dash continuosly as parameters:
```python
velocity_component_2d.enable_dash(3.0, 2)
# or disable it
velocity_component_2d.enable_dash(0.0)

```

## Knockback
When the method `knockback()` is called, a force will be applied which is defined on parameter `knockback_power` that simulates a knockback effect. You can choose the direction in which it will be pushed and other power amount instead of the default one.

```python
func _on_slash_attack_area_entered(area: Area2D):
	var target = area.get_parent() as Player
	
	target.velocity_component_2d.knockback(self.velocity_component_2d.velocity)
	# or new knockback power
	target.velocity_component_2d.knockback(self.velocity_component_2d.velocity, 500)
```

## Signals
```python
signal dashed
signal knockback_received
```
